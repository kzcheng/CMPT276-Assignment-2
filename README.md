## Student Tracker
A small web app designed to track a group of students. Deployed on Render.com.

## Deployment (TODO Needs update)
### Render.com
Currently, this project is being hosted on: <https://cmpt276-assignment-1-nqf7.onrender.com/quizApp.html>

### Deploying Locally
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the Java file in `src\main\java\cmpt276\kzcheng\asn2\asn2Application.java`.
3. Install any dependencies needed if any are missing and try again.
4. Visit `http://localhost:9090/quizApp.html` to see the web app.

## Notes for Marking This
### Port ID
The port when deploying this project to `localhost` have been changed to `9090`. This is because `8080` is being used by a local LLM that have the port number be hardcoded in.

### Commits with Descriptions
Some commits may have more details in descriptions. Especially ones with more jokingly titles.
